Steps to run the Code:
----------------------

1. Save the file with a .html extension.
3. Open the file with a web browser like Google Chrome/Firefox etc., to see the output.

Big-Oh Runtime:
---------------

1. The Big-Oh runtime for the code would be : O(n), where 'n' is the length of the Fibonacci sequence to be displayed.
2. Space Complexity of this algorithm : O(1).
